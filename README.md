### Python 3 (Required)

- Must install package dependencies using `pip3 install <package-name>` in your CLI.

- If any packages are still needed, see your console in VS Code, or your CLI for the respective error message.

### Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
- We recommend downloading VS Code, as that is the code editor we used in development (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- This is not required, but we are not liable for errors encountered because of not using VS Code.
